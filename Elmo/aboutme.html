    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <fieldset>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Dark Elmo P. Bernardo, a twenty-year-old student at Tarlac State University (TSU), currently in my third year of college.</p>

        <p>I come from a family of four, including my sibling and me. We're a tight-knit bunch, always supporting each other through thick and thin.</p>    
        
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, and biking. These activities help me stay active and unwind after a busy day of studies.</p>
        
        <p>I'm also a big fan of online gaming. It's a fun way to connect with friends and challenge myself in new virtual worlds.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not playing sports or gaming, you'll likely find me exploring new places. I love traveling and discovering the beauty of different cultures and landscapes.</p>        
        <p>Thanks for stopping by to learn a bit about me. Feel free to browse my portfolio, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Have a great day!</p>
