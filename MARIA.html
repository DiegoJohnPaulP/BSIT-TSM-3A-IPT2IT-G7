            Every person may feel that they have no purpose in life but finding out who you are just takes the time of sitting down and thinking of the importance in your life. I want you to remember me, I am Maria Yzabella Ghryz Arellano, Lives in Pura, Tarlac. My date of birth is on August 08 2003, 20 years old,  I am now 3rd year students in Tarlac State University studying Information Technology. I'm aware of the benefits of securing an opportunity to pursue learning in university, in short I believe that the education will equip me with skills that will further my career goals.

We all know that college is a thing worth waiting for not just because you'll be free from your parents but because you will able to manage and learn to live an independent life. Always keeping myself motivated in all things because this was my first step in the ladder of success.
